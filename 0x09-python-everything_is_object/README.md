# 0x09. Python - Everything is object
## Python Variables and Data Structures


This project focuses on Python variables and data structures. It explores fundamental concepts related to variables, lists, tuples, and their behavior in Python.

## Description
This project provides examples and exercises to help you understand and practice working with variables and various data structures in Python. It covers topics such as variable assignment, reassignment, swapping, list creation, access, slicing, concatenation, tuple creation, access, packing, and unpacking.

## Contents
The project includes the following components:

- Files: Each task has a corresponding file that contains a code snippet or a question to be answered.
- Instructions: Each file contains instructions for the task it represents.
Answers: Some files have answer files (*-answer.txt) that provide the expected output or solution to the task.
### - Usage:
```
./my_python_main_file.py

```

You can use this project to enhance your understanding of Python variables and data structures. The files contain instructions or code snippets for each task, and you can try solving them on your own. Compare your solutions with the answer files `(*-answer.txt)` provided to validate your understanding.

Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different approaches. This project is designed to be interactive and encourage hands-on learning.
