# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development
My ALX software engineering project on python test driven development

Test-driven development '(TDD)' in Python is a software development approach that emphasizes writing automated tests before writing the actual 'code". By following this methodology, developers can gain more confidence in their code and ensure that it meets the desired 'functionality'. 'TDD' helps in detecting and fixing 'bugs' early in the development process, resulting in more robust and reliable software. It promotes a systematic and incremental approach to development, where tests serve as a guide for writing code and validating its correctness. With Python's extensive testing frameworks and libraries, such as unittest and pytest, practitioners of TDD can efficiently write test cases, execute them, and track the progress of their codebase. By adhering to the principles of TDD, Python developers can create cleaner, more maintainable code and foster a culture of quality and reliability in their software projects.
