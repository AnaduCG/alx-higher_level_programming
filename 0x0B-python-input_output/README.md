0x0B. Python - Input/Output
This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of input/output operations in Python, specifically focusing on file handling, cursor manipulation, file closure, the usage of the with statement, JSON, serialization, and deserialization. It includes examples demonstrating how to perform file operations, convert Python data structures to JSON strings, and vice versa.

1. Opening a File <a name="opening-a-file"></a>
To open a file in Python, you can use the open() function. It requires specifying the file path and the mode (e.g., read, write, append). For example:

python
Copy code
file = open("file.txt", "r")  # Open file.txt in read mode
2. Writing Text to a File <a name="writing-text-to-a-file"></a>
To write text to a file, open the file in write mode ("w") or append mode ("a") and use the write() method to write the content. For example:

python
Copy code
file = open("file.txt", "w")  # Open file.txt in write mode
file.write("Hello, World!")
file.close()  # Remember to close the file
3. Reading the Full Content of a File <a name="reading-the-full-content-of-a-file"></a>
To read the full content of a file, open the file in read mode ("r") and use the read() method. It will return the entire content as a string. For example:

python
Copy code
file = open("file.txt", "r")  # Open file.txt in read mode
content = file.read()
file.close()  # Remember to close the file

print(content)
4. Reading a File Line by Line <a name="reading-a-file-line-by-line"></a>
To read a file line by line, open the file in read mode ("r") and use a loop to iterate over the file object. The readline() method can be used to read each line. For example:

python
Copy code
file = open("file.txt", "r")  # Open file.txt in read mode

for line in file:
    print(line)

file.close()  # Remember to close the file
5. Moving the Cursor in a File <a name="moving-the-cursor-in-a-file"></a>
The file cursor represents the current position within the file. To move the cursor, you can use the seek() method. It requires specifying the offset and optional reference point. For example:

python
Copy code
file = open("file.txt", "r")  # Open file.txt in read mode

file.seek(10)  # Move the cursor to position 10
content = file.read()

print(content)

file.close()  # Remember to close the file
6. Closing a File <a name="closing-a-file"></a>
After performing file operations, it is essential to close the file to release system resources. You can use the close() method to close the file. For example:

python
Copy code
file = open("file.txt", "r")  # Open file.txt in read mode
# File operations here
file.close()  # Close the file
7. Understanding and Using the with Statement <a name="understanding-and-using-the-with-statement"></a>
The with statement is used to ensure proper handling and automatic closure of files. It guarantees that the file is closed even if an exception occurs. Here's an example:

python
Copy code
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()

print(content)  # File is automatically closed outside the 'with' block
8. Introduction to JSON <a name="introduction-to-json"></a>
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format. It is commonly used to store and transmit data between a server and a web application. In Python, the json module provides functions for working with JSON data.

9. Serialization <a name="serialization"></a>
Serialization is the process of converting an object's state to a format that can be stored or transmitted. In the context of JSON, it refers to converting a Python data structure into a JSON string.

10. Deserialization <a name="deserialization"></a>
Deserialization is the reverse process of serialization. It involves converting a serialized format (such as a JSON string) back into a Python data structure.

11. Converting Python Data Structures to JSON Strings <a name="converting-python-data-structures-to-json-strings"></a>
To convert a Python data structure to a JSON string, you can use the json.dumps() function. It serializes the object into a JSON formatted string. For example:

python
Copy code
import json

data = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 25,
    "city": "New York"
}

json_string = json.dumps(data)
print(json_string)
12. Converting JSON Strings to Python Data Structures <a name="converting-json-strings-to-python-data-structures"></a>
To convert a JSON string to a Python data structure, you can use the json.loads() function. It deserializes the JSON string into a corresponding Python object. For example:

python
Copy code
import json

json_string = '{"name": "John Doe", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}'

data = json.loads(json_string)
print(data["name"])
These examples provide an overview of input/output operations in Python, including file handling, cursor manipulation, file closure, the with statement, JSON, serialization, and deserialization.
